Revision history for Template::Timer

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Measurements are now in milliseconds, not seconds.

    Now shows nesting level in the notes.

    The times are all shown as a summary at the end, not throughout
    the page.

    [FIXES]
    When calling

        [% PROCESS block_1 + block_2 %]

    the block names are passed as an array reference to process().
    Template::Timer was assuming that any ref() passed was an object
    and calling ->name on that object.  Thanks to Bill Moseley.
