Revision history for Template::Timer

        [FIXES]
        When calling

            [% PROCESS block_1 + block_2 %]

        the block names are passed as an array reference to process().
        Template::Timer was assuming that any ref() passed was an object
        and calling ->name on that object.  Thanks to Bill Moseley.
