NAME
    Template::ShowStartStop - Display where templates start and stop

VERSION
    version 0.30.0

SYNOPSIS
            use Template::ShowStartStop;

            my $tt = Template->new({
                    CONTEXT => Template::ShowStartStop->new
            });

DESCRIPTION
    Template::ShowStartStop provides inline comments throughout your code
    where each template stops and starts. It's an overridden version of
    Template::Context that wraps the "process()" method.

    Using Template::ShowStartStop is simple. Now when you process templates,
    HTML comments will get embedded in your output, which you can easily
    grep for. The nesting level is also shown.

            <!-- START: process wrapper.tt -->
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
            <!-- START: process head.tt -->
            ...
            <!-- STOP:  process head.tt -->
            </head>
            ...
            </html>
            <!-- STOP:  process wrapper.tt -->
