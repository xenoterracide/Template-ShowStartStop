NAME
    Template::ShowStartStop - Display where template's start and stop

VERSION
    version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
            use Template::ShowStartStop;

            my %config = ( # Whatever your config is
                    INCLUDE_PATH    => '/my/template/path',
                    COMPILE_EXT      => '.ttc',
                    COMPILE_DIR      => '/tmp/tt',
            );

            $config{ CONTEXT } = Template::ShowStartStop->new( %config );

            my $template = Template->new( \%config );

DESCRIPTION
    Template::ShowStartStop provides inline comments througout your code
    where each template stops and starts. It's an overridden version of
    Template::Context that wraps the "process()" method.

    Using Template::ShowStartStop is simple. Now when you process templates,
    HTML comments will get embedded in your output, which you can easily
    grep for. The nesting level is also shown.

            <!-- START: process mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
            <!-- STOP:  process mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->

            ....

            <!-- STOP:  process mainmenu/footer.tt -->

    Please report any bugs or feature requests on
    <http://github.com/xenoterracide/Template-ShowStartStop/issues> as I'm
    not fond of RT.
