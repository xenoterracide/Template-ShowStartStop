NAME
    Template::ShowStartStop - Display where template's start and stop

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Template::ShowStartStop provides inline comments througout your code
    where each template stops and starts. It's an overridden version of
    Template::Context that wraps the "process()" method.

    Using Template::ShowStartStop is simple.

            use Template::ShowStartStop;

            my %config = ( # Whatever your config is
                    INCLUDE_PATH    => '/my/template/path',
                    COMPILE_EXT      => '.ttc',
                    COMPILE_DIR      => '/tmp/tt',
            );

            if ( $development_mode ) {
                    $config{ CONTEXT } = Template::ShowStartStop->new( %config );
            }

            my $template = Template->new( \%config );

    Now when you process templates, HTML comments will get embedded in your
    output, which you can easily grep for. The nesting level is also shown.

            <!-- START: include mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
            <!-- STOP:  include mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->

            ....

            <!-- STOP:  include mainmenu/footer.tt -->
